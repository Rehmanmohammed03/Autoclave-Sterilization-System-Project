# Engineer 1P13: Integrated Cornerstone Design Projects in Engineering - Healthcare Challenge

This is a project completed for the Engineer 1P13: Integrated Cornerstone Design Projects in Engineering course. The project focused on finding a solution to a healthcare-related problem through the engineering design process.

## Objective

The objective of the healthcare challenge was to create a sterilization container for a surgical tool or write a computer program to control a robotic q-arm via muscle sensors.

## Learning Components

During this project, we learned:

- The engineering design process
- How to make informed decisions based on design goals and constraints
- How to create Python code that is easy to understand
- How to conduct research and cite sources in IEEE format
- How to work effectively in a team in a real-life engineering environment

## Highlights

Some of the highlights of this project were:

- Controlling a real robotic q-arm and programming it to complete specific tasks
- Becoming familiar with the q-labs environment and the Raspberry Pi
- Researching biomaterials associated with hip implants

## Skills Developed

We developed the following skills during this project:

- Proficiency in coding Python
- Knowledge about biomaterials
- Scholarly research skills
- IEEE citation skills

## Conclusion

Overall, this project was an introduction to how multiple projects can contribute to a singular solution, and the skills that we developed are crucial to our development in the McMaster Engineering program. We look forward to our future projects in this course and working with different problems and solutions.

## Acknowledgements

We would like to acknowledge our professor and teaching assistants who provided guidance and support throughout this project. We would also like to acknowledge our team members for their hard work and dedication to this project.
